Nomio
===

Inspired by [FileBot](https://www.filebot.net/), Nomio yearns to be an open source alternative to it. Currently in its infancy, its functionaily is limited to the most useful function of file renaming, i.e. mass renaming of Series/TV-Show titles.

The example below illustrates how Nomio would be used to mass rename a series by identifying episodes using the custom Regex specified then removing and changing parts of the each episodes' title as specified in the respective fields.
